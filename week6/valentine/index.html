        <h1>My Dearest HTML & CSS,</h1>
        <p>From the moment we met, I knew we were meant to be. You, with your structured elegance and endless creative potential, have captured my heart in ways I never imagined.<br><br>
            
            HTML, you are the foundation of my world, giving structure to my wildest ideas. You are logical, reliable, and always there to support me. And CSS, my beautifully unpredictable muse—you bring life and color to the dullest of days, turning plain words into works of art.<br><br>
            
            But, oh, how difficult our love is. Your rules are strict, your quirks frustrating. A missing semicolon can break us apart, and positioning elements feels like solving an ancient riddle. You promise simplicity, yet you hide your secrets deep within a cascade of confusion. Just when I think I understand you, you change, slipping through my grasp like a floated div refusing to stay where I put it.<br><br>
            
            Still, I won’t give up on us. Through trial and error, through flexbox frustrations and margin mishaps, I will learn your ways. Because despite the struggle, I know you're worth it.<br><br>
            
            Forever yours (even when I rage quit),<br><br>
            -David</p>
